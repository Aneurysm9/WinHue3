NOTE : You need Microsoft Dot Net Framework 4.5.1 for this program to work properly. 
You might also need Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable library. 
Both are available at Microsoft's website. 

Fixed:
- Pairing not working.

Added:
- Floor plan creator and viewer.
- Option to export the current config.

Changed:
- Corrected button size in the bridge pairing window.
- Made read-only capabilities in the bridge settings window.
- settings will no longer remember api version but will get the most recent from the bridge when checking it at startup preventing a bug.
